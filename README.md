Learning programming and code through my folk tune repertoire

This is my first foray into GitHub! I am hoping to develop skills in open-source data visualization and mapping solutions such as Leaflet, Shiny, and Python-based data visualization solutions. I have a little experience with ESRI products and Microsoft PowerBI. I'm hoping to learn to program similar tools using open source methods. 

I decided that the data set I would like to map and analyze is my repertoire of traditional folk tunes which I am learning to play on the Anglo concertina. 

This readme will be updated as I develop my project and skills.
